# Custom Script for Downloading Everything after a fresh R&I

This is my custom setup for when I erase my Mac everytime.
The reason I created this is because I got tired of redownloading everything.

Before you continue, make sure that you download **_iTerm_**

You can download everything


```
git clone https://github.com/ethanbonin/Custom-Home-Set-Up.git ~/Environment && sh ~/Environment/environment/install.sh
```


# Manual Install

If you are interested in some of the custom installs and not all it, then I have broke it down modually to be installed.

The custom scripts are

+ Custom Vim
+ Custom Oh-My-Zsh
+ Custom NPM, Node, React, React-native
+ Custom Ruby On rails. 


I'm sure I'll add more in the future. But for now,

cheers.
