#Custom Script for Downloading Everything after a fresh R&I

This is my custom setup for when I erase my Mac everytime.
The reason I created this is because I got tired of redownloading everything.

Before you continue, make sure that you download **_iTerm_**

You can download everything


```git clone https://github.com/ethanbonin/Custom-Home-Set-Up.git ~/```
```sh ~/Custom-Home-Set-Up/environment/install.sh```
